🧪 Diabetes Progression Prediction
This project demonstrates a simple Linear Regression model to predict diabetes disease progression using the Body Mass Index (BMI) feature from the built-in scikit-learn diabetes dataset.
📌 Objective
To build a linear regression model that predicts disease progression based on BMI and evaluate the model's performance using visualization and error metrics.
🗂️ Project Workflow
Load Dataset
The diabetes dataset is loaded from sklearn.datasets.
Feature Selection
Independent Variable: BMI
Dependent Variable: Disease progression
Data Splitting
The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
Model Training
A Linear Regression model is trained using the training data.
Model Interpretation
Model coefficients and intercept are printed.
Predictions are made on the test data.
Model Evaluation
Mean Squared Error (MSE) is calculated to evaluate prediction accuracy.
Visualization
A scatter plot of actual vs predicted values is created.
A regression line is added to visualize the model’s performance.
