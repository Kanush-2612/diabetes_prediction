Diabetes Progression Prediction
This project demonstrates a simple Linear Regression model to predict diabetes progression based on Body Mass Index (BMI) using the scikit-learn diabetes dataset.
ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
Data Loading
The diabetes dataset is loaded from scikit-learn.
Feature Selection
Independent Variable: BMI (Body Mass Index)
Dependent Variable: Disease progression (quantitative measure)
Data Splitting
The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
Model Training
A Linear Regression model is trained on the training data.
Model Evaluation
The model's coefficient and intercept are displayed.
Predictions are made on the test set.
The performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Visualization
A scatter plot shows actual vs. predicted values.
A regression line illustrates the model's fit.
ðŸ§© Dependencies
Make sure the following Python libraries are installed:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
